# Embassy Appointment Scheduler

This Python script automates scheduling appointments for U.S. visa applicants at embassy facilities. I used it to schedule apointment in Dubai in Feb 2025 for my friend. It can check availability, automatically log in, and attempt to reschedule appointments based on certain criteria. The script is designed for flexibility and can be modified to work with other embassy locations or scheduling systems.

## Features:
 - Login Automation: Automatically logs into the embassy's appointment system.
 - Appointment Checking: Retrieves available dates and times from the embassy system.
 - Rescheduling: Automatically attempts to reschedule appointments if suitable dates are found.
 - Date Filtering: Filters dates based on a given period and selects the closest available date.
 - Customizable: Can be easily configured to work with different embassies or regions.
